            By accessing and using the Website, you represent that you understand the inherent risks associated with using cryptographic and blockchain-based systems, and that you have a working knowledge of the usage and intricacies of digital assets such as bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), and other digital tokens such as those following the Ethereum Token Standard (ERC-20). You further understand that the markets for these digital assets are highly volatile due to factors including (but not limited to) adoption, speculation, technology, security, and regulation. You acknowledge that the cost and speed of transacting with cryptographic and blockchain-based systems such as Ethereum are variable and may increase dramatically at any time. You further acknowledge the risk that your digital assets may lose some or all of their value while they are supplied to the Protocol. If you borrow digital assets from the Protocol, you will have to supply digital assets of your own as collateral. If your collateral declines in value such that it is no longer sufficient to secure the amount that you borrowed, others may interact with the Protocol to seize your collateral in a liquidation event. You further acknowledge that we are not responsible for any of these variables or risks, do not own or control the Protocol, and cannot be held liable for any resulting losses that you experience while accessing or using the Website. <strong>Accordingly, you understand and agree to assume full responsibility for all of the risks of accessing and using the Website and interacting with the Protocol.</strong>
